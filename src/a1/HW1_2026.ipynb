However,  you have just read one of the most popular machine learning books and it argues that standard linear regression (for finding $\\mathbf{w}$) can lead to various problems such as non-uniqueness of the solution,  overfitting, etc. As a result, you decided to add a penalty term called regularization to control the optimisation problem.

In particular, between the questions for which you have reasonably attempted a solution, we will pick the one where the difference between the full point and the point you received is the maximum."
